# modular-battlemap

# Goals
We want to make a modular battlemap system that:
- Consists of modular tiles, like 4x4 tiles at 25.4mm scale
- That tiles together with minimal whitespace
- That transmits power/data through the edges
- and is capable of arbitrarly lighting 4 RGB LEDs per square.
- can be powered / controlled from one "base map" tile, that has USB-C output.
